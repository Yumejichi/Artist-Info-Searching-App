## About

A full-stack web application for searching and exploring artist information using the Artsy API. This application demonstrates my skills in building modern web applications with Angular frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and MongoDB database integration.

**Key Highlights:**

- RESTful API design with Express.js
- JWT-based authentication system
- Integration with external API (Artsy)
- Responsive UI with Angular and Bootstrap
- User favorites management system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** - [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- **Artsy API Credentials** - Register at [developers.artsy.net](https://developers.artsy.net/) to get Client ID and Secret

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yumejichi/Artist-Info-Searching-App.git
cd Artist-Info-Searching-App
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
ARTSY_TOKEN_CLIENTID=your_artsy_client_id
ARTSY_TOKEN_CLIENTSECRET=your_artsy_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Development Mode (Recommended for Testing)

Run frontend and backend separately for development with hot-reload:

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Uses nodemon for auto-reload
```

Backend will run on: `http://localhost:3000`

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:4200`

The frontend proxy is already configured in `proxy.conf.json` to forward API requests to the backend.

### Production Mode

To run in production mode (backend serves built frontend files):

1. Build the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Copy build output to `backend/public/` (if not already there)

3. Start the backend:

```bash
cd ../backend
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📡 API Endpoints

| `POST` | `/api/login`    | User login                   |
| `POST` | `/api/logout`   | User logout                  |
| `GET`  | `/api/me`       | Get current user information |

## 🚢 Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Google App Engine)

The backend is configured for Google App Engine deployment with `app.yaml`.

1. Install Google Cloud SDK
2. Configure your project:

```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

3. Deploy:

```bash
cd backend
gcloud app deploy
```

The backend serves the built frontend files from the `public/` directory, so both frontend and backend are deployed together.

## How to Use

Once the application is running:

1. **Search for Artists**: Use the search bar on the home page to find artists by name
2. **View Artist Details**: Click on any artist card to see their detailed profile, biography, and artwork gallery
3. **Register/Login**: Create a new account or login to enable favorites functionality
4. **Save Favorites**: While logged in, click the favorite button (❤️) on artist pages to save them
5. **Manage Favorites**: Visit the Favorites page from the navigation menu to view and manage your saved artists
