To run the project locally, there are two ways:
1. The backend itself will run on localhost:3000 in the backend folder.
(The frontend built files serve as static files in public in the backend)

But I also included the raw files from the front end.
If running both, please use localhost:4200 in the frontend folder and localhost:3000 in the backend folder.

I only deployed my backend so the backend folder is all needed for the deployment.
