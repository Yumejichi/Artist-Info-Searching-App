## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
- **Artsy API Credentials** (Client ID and Client Secret)

## Environment Variables Setup

### Backend Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following variables:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
ARTSY_TOKEN_CLIENTID=your_artsy_client_id
ARTSY_TOKEN_CLIENTSECRET=your_artsy_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### Getting Artsy API Credentials

1. Visit https://developers.artsy.net/
2. Create an account and register your application
3. Obtain your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Add them to your `.env` file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yumejichi/Artist-Info-Searching-App.git
cd Artist-Info-Searching-App
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

There are two ways to run this application:

### Option 1: Production Mode (Recommended for Deployment)

This runs both frontend and backend together. The backend serves the built frontend files.

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Copy the built files to backend public directory:
```bash
# The build output should冫 be copied to backend/public/
# (This may already be done if deploying)
```

3. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd ../backend
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Development Mode

Run frontend and backend separately for development with hot-reload:

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Uses nodemon for auto-reload
```
Backend will run on: `http://localhost:3000`

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:4200`

3. Configure the frontend proxy (already configured in `proxy.conf.json`) to forward API requests to the backend.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/login` - User login
- `POST /api/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/me` - Get current user information

### Artsy API Proxy
- `GET /api/artsy/search` - Search for artists
- `GET /api/artsy/artist/:id` - Get artist details
- `GET /api/artsy/artworks` - Get artist artworks

### Favorites (Protected)
- `POST /api/favorites` - Add artist to favorites
- `GET /api/favorites` - Get user's favorites
- `DELETE /api/favorites/:id` - Remove artist from favorites

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Google App Engine)

The backend is configured for Google App Engine deployment with `app.yaml`.

1. Install Google Cloud SDK
2. Configure your project:
```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```
3. Deploy:
```bash
cd backend
gcloud app deploy
```

The backend serves the built frontend files from the `public/` directory, so both frontend and backend are deployed together.

## Usage

1. **Search for Artists**: Use the search bar on the home page to find artists
2. **View Artist Details**: Click on any artist to see their profile, biography, and artworks
3. **Register/Login**: Create an account or login to save favorite artists
4. **Save Favorites**: While logged in, click the favorite button on artist pages
5. **Manage Favorites**: Visit the Favorites page to view and remove saved artists
